# SMS Auto-Responder Persistence Fix

## Issue
The SMS auto-responder configuration is not being persisted properly. When you make changes to the settings, they work initially but get reset after other changes or server restarts.

## Root Cause
The SMS auto-responder service was being recreated as a new instance each time, losing its configuration. The configuration was not being properly loaded from the database on initialization.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Singleton Pattern
- Added singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the service exists
- Configuration is now shared across all references to the service

### 2. Configuration Loading
- Added `ensureConfigLoaded()` method to load configuration from database
- Configuration is loaded before processing any SMS
- Added `configLoaded` flag to prevent unnecessary database calls

### 3. Database Persistence
- Fixed the `updateConfig()` method to properly save to database
- Configuration is now saved immediately when updated
- Added proper error handling for database operations

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
node test-sms-config-persistence.js
```

This script will:
- Test configuration loading and saving
- Verify persistence across service instances
- Check OpenAI API key configuration
- Provide detailed feedback on what's working

### 2. Manual Testing
1. **Configure the SMS auto-responder:**
   - Go to AI Messaging → SMS Auto-Respond tab
   - Enable the feature
   - Set confidence threshold to 0.8
   - Add some excluded keywords
   - Save the configuration

2. **Test persistence:**
   - Restart your server: `npm run dev`
   - Go back to the SMS auto-responder settings
   - Verify your settings are still there

3. **Test functionality:**
   - Use the test interface to send a sample SMS
   - Check that auto-responses are working
   - Verify the configuration is being used

## Files Modified

### `server/sms-auto-respond-service.ts`
- Added singleton pattern with `getInstance()` method
- Added `ensureConfigLoaded()` method
- Added `configLoaded` flag
- Fixed configuration loading and saving

### `server/routes.ts`
- Updated to use `SMSAutoRespondService.getInstance(storage)`

### `test-sms-config-persistence.js` (New)
- Comprehensive test script for configuration persistence

## Configuration Flow

### Before Fix
1. Service created with default config
2. User updates config → saved to memory only
3. Service recreated → loses all changes
4. Configuration reset to defaults

### After Fix
1. Service created with default config
2. User updates config → saved to database
3. Service loads config from database on first use
4. Configuration persists across restarts

## Troubleshooting

### If Configuration Still Resets

1. **Check Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   node test-sms-config-persistence.js
   ```
   Look for database connection errors

2. **Verify Database Table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ai_messaging_config;
   ```
   Should show your configuration

3. **Check Server Logs:**
   Look for "SMS auto-respond config loaded from database" messages

### If OpenAI API Key is Missing

1. **Set up the API key:**
   ```bash
   node fix-sms-auto-responder.js sk-your-api-key-here
   ```

2. **Verify the key is stored:**
   ```bash
   node test-sms-config-persistence.js
   ```

## Best Practices

### For Configuration Changes
1. Always use the admin interface to make changes
2. Test the configuration immediately after saving
3. Restart the server to verify persistence
4. Use the test script to verify everything is working

### For Development
1. Run the test script after making changes
2. Check server logs for configuration loading messages
3. Verify database records are being created/updated
4. Test with actual SMS messages

## Monitoring

### Server Logs to Watch For
- `"SMS auto-respond config loaded from database"`
- `"SMS auto-respond configuration updated"`
- `"Processing incoming SMS for auto-response"`

### Database Records to Monitor
```sql
SELECT id, enabled, sms_enabled, confidence_threshold, updated_at 
FROM ai_messaging_config;
```

## Support

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Run the test script** and share the output
2. **Check server logs** for error messages
3. **Verify database connectivity**
4. **Ensure OpenAI API key is configured**

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Configuration persists across server restarts
- ✅ Settings are loaded from database on startup
- ✅ Changes are immediately saved to database
- ✅ Singleton pattern prevents configuration loss
- ✅ Proper error handling for database operations
