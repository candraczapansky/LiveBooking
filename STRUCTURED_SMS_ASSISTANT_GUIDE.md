# Structured SMS Assistant Guide

## Overview

The Structured SMS Assistant is an automated SMS booking system that guides users through a step-by-step appointment booking process. It follows a strict conversation workflow and uses function calling to handle availability checks and appointment booking.

## Core Features

### 1. Structured Conversation Flow
The assistant follows an exact 8-step process:

1. **Greeting & Task Identification** - Confirms ability to help with booking
2. **Get Service** - Asks user what service they want to book
3. **Get Date** - Asks for preferred date
4. **Get Available Times** - Calls `get_available_times()` function
5. **Get Chosen Time** - Asks user to select from available times
6. **Get Client Information** - Collects name, email, and phone
7. **Confirm Details** - Summarizes and asks for confirmation
8. **Book Appointment** - Calls `book_appointment()` function

### 2. Function Calling System
The assistant has access to two key functions:

#### `get_available_times(service, date)`
- **Purpose**: Fetches available appointment times for a specific service on a given date
- **Returns**: List of time slots (e.g., ["9:00 AM", "10:30 AM", "2:00 PM"]) or empty list if none available
- **Usage**: Called automatically when service and date are collected

#### `book_appointment(service, date, time, fullName, email, phone)`
- **Purpose**: Books the appointment and creates client profile
- **Returns**: Success or failure message
- **Usage**: Called after all information is collected and confirmed

### 3. Behavioral Rules
- **One Question at a Time**: Never asks for multiple pieces of information simultaneously
- **Invalid Input Handling**: Gently corrects and re-asks questions for invalid input
- **Clarity**: Always explicit about what information is needed next
- **Friendly Tone**: Maintains warm, helpful communication throughout

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/structured-sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "From=%2B1234567890&To=%2B1987654321&Body=Hi%20I%20want%20to%20book%20an%20appointment"
```
