# Conversation Flow Builder - SMS Auto-Responder

## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Complete!

I've successfully created a customizable conversation flow builder for the SMS auto-responder that allows business owners to design their own appointment booking workflows.

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Built

### 1. **Conversation Flow Builder UI**
- **Location**: `client/src/components/llm/sms-auto-respond-settings-new.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Visual flow builder with drag-and-drop interface
  - Step-by-step conversation design
  - Multiple step types: trigger, response, question, condition, action
  - Real-time preview and editing
  - Save, edit, and delete flows

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints**
- **Location**: `server/routes.ts` (lines ~6800-6900)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/sms-auto-respond/conversation-flows` - Get all flows
  - `POST /api/sms-auto-respond/conversation-flows` - Create new flow
  - `PUT /api/sms-auto-respond/conversation-flows` - Update existing flow
  - `DELETE /api/sms-auto-respond/conversation-flows/:id` - Delete flow

### 3. **Database Schema**
- **Location**: `shared/schema.ts` (lines ~1130-1150)
- **Table**: `conversation_flows`
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY) - Unique flow identifier
  - `name` (TEXT) - Display name
  - `description` (TEXT) - Flow description
  - `steps` (TEXT) - JSON array of conversation steps
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN) - Whether flow is active
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Creation time
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Last update time

### 4. **Storage Layer**
- **Location**: `server/storage.ts`
- **Methods**:
  - `getConversationFlows()` - Retrieve all flows
  - `getConversationFlow(id)` - Get specific flow
  - `saveConversationFlow(flow)` - Create new flow
  - `updateConversationFlow(flow)` - Update existing flow
  - `deleteConversationFlow(id)` - Delete flow

### 5. **Database Migration**
- **Location**: `migrations/add_conversation_flows.sql`
- **Status**: âœ… Applied successfully

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### **Step Types Available**

1. **Trigger** - Keywords that activate the flow
   - Example: "book, appointment, schedule"

2. **Response** - AI-generated messages
   - Example: "Great! I'd love to help you book an appointment. What service would you like?"

3. **Question** - Interactive prompts with conditions
   - Example: "Which service would you like to book?"

4. **Condition** - Logic-based branching
   - Example: Check if service is available

5. **Action** - System actions
   - Example: "book_appointment", "send_confirmation"

### **Example Flow Structure**

```
1. Trigger: "book, appointment, schedule"
2. Response: "Great! I'd love to help you book an appointment. What service would you like?"
3. Question: "Which service would you like to book?"
4. Response: "Perfect! What date would you like to come in?"
5. Question: "What date works for you?"
6. Response: "Great! Here are the available times: {available_times}. Which time works best?"
7. Action: "book_appointment"
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### **Access the Flow Builder**

1. Go to **AI Messaging** page
2. Click the **"SMS Auto"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Conversation Flows"** section
4. Click **"Create Flow"** or **"Create Your First Flow"**

### **Creating a Custom Flow**

1. **Name Your Flow**: Give it a descriptive name
2. **Add Description**: Explain what the flow does
3. **Design Steps**:
   - Click **"Add Step"** for each conversation step
   - Choose step type (trigger, response, question, etc.)
   - Fill in the content for each step
   - Set conditions and actions as needed
4. **Save Flow**: Click **"Save Flow"** when done

### **Managing Flows**

- **Delete**: Click the **"Delete"** button (with confirmation)
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Toggle the **"Active"** switch

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**

```typescript
interface ConversationFlow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  steps: ConversationStep[];
  isActive: boolean;

}

interface ConversationStep {
  id: string;
  type: 'trigger' | 'response' | 'question' | 'condition' | 'action';
  name: string;
  content: string;
  conditions?: string[];
  actions?: string[];
  nextStepId?: string;
  order: number;
}
```

### **Backend Integration**

The conversation flows integrate with the existing SMS auto-responder system:
