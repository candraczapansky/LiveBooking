# üö® AI RESPONDER STATUS CHECK

## ‚úÖ Python AI Service: RUNNING
The AI is responding correctly with:
- "Hello! Welcome to our salon. I'm your AI assistant..."
- Service is healthy on port 8000

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

### Option 1: Test AI Directly (FASTEST)
1. Go to Twilio Console
2. Find your phone number
3. Change webhook to: `https://dev-booking-91625-candraczapansky.replit.app/api/webhook/voice?ai=true`
4. Call your number - AI answers immediately

### Option 2: Fix Yealink Fallback (PERMANENT)
Your Node.js app needs restart to activate the fallback system:

1. **In Replit:**
   - Click "Stop" button (‚èπÔ∏è)
   - Wait 2 seconds  
   - Click "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)

2. **After restart, the flow will be:**
   - Call comes in ‚Üí Yealink rings for 10 seconds
   - Front desk can answer during this time
   - If no answer ‚Üí AI picks up automatically

## üìû TEST THE SYSTEM:
After restarting, make a test call:
1. Let it ring (don't answer the Yealink)
2. After 10 seconds, you should hear: "Hello! Welcome to our salon..."

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING:
If AI still doesn't answer after 10 seconds:
- The Yealink might be auto-answering (check Yealink settings)
- The webhook URL might need updating in Twilio

## üí° CURRENT STATUS:
- Python AI: ‚úÖ Running on port 8000
- Node.js App: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs restart to load new code
- Yealink: Primary answering method (unchanged)
- Fallback: Will work after Node.js restart
