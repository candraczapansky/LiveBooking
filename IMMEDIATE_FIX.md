# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## The Problem
Your AI responder shows "Sorry, all our representatives are busy" because the deployed Replit can't reach the Python service at localhost:8000.

## Quick Solution Options:

### Option 1: Use glofloapp.com Domain (If You Own It)
If you have control over glofloapp.com:
1. Point a subdomain like `api.glofloapp.com` to your Replit app
2. Update Twilio webhook to: `https://api.glofloapp.com/api/webhook/voice`
3. This might avoid any Replit-specific issues

### Option 2: Deploy to Railway/Render (Free Tier)
These services better support multi-process apps:
```bash
# Railway: railway.app
# Render: render.com
# Both offer free tiers and easy deployment
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix in Replit
1. Go to your Replit dashboard
2. Click the "Shell" tab
3. Run these commands:
```bash
# Stop everything
pkill -f node
pkill -f python

# Rebuild with AI responder integrated
npm run build

# Start fresh
npm start
```

4. Wait for "Server running on port" message
5. Test the webhook

## Current Issue
- ‚úÖ Yealink routing works
- ‚úÖ Webhook is accessible 
- ‚ùå Python AI service not reachable in deployed environment
- ‚úÖ Built-in AI responder added (needs rebuild to activate)

## Testing After Fix
```bash
curl -X POST https://dev-booking-91625-candraczapansky.replit.app/api/webhook/voice/no-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "DialCallStatus=no-answer&CallSid=TEST"
```

Should return:
```xml
<Say voice="alice">
  Hello! Thank you for calling Glo Head Spa. I'm your AI assistant...
</Say>
```

Not:
```xml
<Say voice="alice">
  Sorry, all our representatives are busy...
</Say>
```
