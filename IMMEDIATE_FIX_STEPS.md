# 🎉 IMMEDIATE FIX: Your Webhook is Working!

## ✅ **Great News!**

Your webhook is working perfectly through LocalTunnel at:
**`https://icy-mammals-begin.loca.lt`**

The test returned valid TwiML, which means your voice system is ready!

## 🚀 **Immediate Steps to Fix the "Application Error"**

### **Step 1: Update Twilio Webhooks**

1. **Go to [console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com)**
2. **Navigate to**: Phone Numbers → Manage → Active numbers
3. **Click on**: `+19187277348`
4. **Update these URLs**:
   - **Voice Webhook URL**: `https://icy-mammals-begin.loca.lt/webhook/voice`
   - **Status Callback URL**: `https://icy-mammals-begin.loca.lt/webhook/voice/status`
5. **Save configuration**

### **Step 2: Test Your Phone Number**

Call: `+19187277348`

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After updating the Twilio webhooks, when you call your phone number, you should hear:

> "Hello! Welcome to our salon. I'm your AI assistant. How can I help you today?"

**No more "application error" messages!** ✅

## 🧪 **Verification**

The webhook test returned:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say language="en-US" voice="alice">Hello! Welcome to our salon. I'm your AI assistant. How can I help you today?</Say>
  <Gather action="/webhook/voice/process?call_sid=test123" enhanced="true" input="speech" language="en-US" method="POST" speechModel="phone_call" speechTimeout="auto">
    <Say language="en-US" voice="alice">I didn't catch that. Could you please repeat your request?</Say>
  </Gather>
</Response>
```

This is exactly what Twilio expects!

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **LocalTunnel URLs are temporary** - they will change if you restart the tunnel

1. **Deploy to Railway** for a permanent solution
2. **Point your domain** `gloheadspa.app` to the deployed app
3. **Update Twilio webhooks** to use your domain
