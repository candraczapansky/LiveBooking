## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The SMS auto-responder was giving confusing and inappropriate responses to simple messages. The logic was overly complex and not properly handling different types of messages.

## 🔍 **Issues Identified**

2. **Confusing Responses**: Business questions were getting inappropriate booking-focused responses

## ✅ **Improvements Made**

### 1. **Improved Intent Detection Logic**

```typescript
// NEW: Priority-based intent detection
