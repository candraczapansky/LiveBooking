# Voice Quality Improvements for AI Responder

## ‚úÖ Changes Implemented

I've successfully implemented voice quality improvements to make your AI responder sound more natural and human-like. Here's what was changed:

### 1. **Amazon Polly Voices**
- Switched from robotic 'alice' voice to natural-sounding Amazon Polly voices
- Default: `Polly.Joanna` - A clear, professional US female voice
- Fully configurable via environment variables

### 2. **SSML Support**
- Added Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) formatting
- Automatic insertion of natural pauses after sentences and commas
- Creates more natural speech rhythm and cadence

### 3. **Enhanced Speech Recognition**
- Upgraded from `phone_call` to `experimental_conversations` model
- Better accuracy and understanding of caller speech
- Disabled profanity filter for improved recognition

### 4. **AI Response Optimization**
- Updated system prompt to generate voice-friendly responses
- Shorter, more conversational sentences
- Avoids complex punctuation that sounds unnatural when spoken

## üé§ Available Voice Options

### Recommended Voices:
- **Polly.Joanna** (US Female) - Clear, professional ‚≠ê DEFAULT
- **Polly.Amy** (UK Female) - British accent, friendly
- **Polly.Salli** (US Female) - Younger sounding voice
- **Polly.Matthew** (US Male) - Professional male voice

### Other Options:
- Polly.Nicole (Australian Female)
- Polly.Brian (US Male)
- Polly.Russell (Australian Male)
- Polly.Conchita (Spanish)
- Polly.Celine (French)
- Polly.Marlene (German)

## üìù Configuration

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Voice Configuration
TWILIO_VOICE=Polly.Joanna
TWILIO_VOICE_LANGUAGE=en-US
```

## üöÄ Testing the Improvements

To test the voice quality improvements:

1. **Restart the application** to pick up the changes:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current process (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   python python_sms_responder/main.py
   ```

2. **Call your Twilio number** and listen for:
   - More natural greeting voice
   - Better speech rhythm with pauses
   - Clearer, more human-like responses

3. **Try different voices** by changing `TWILIO_VOICE` in your `.env`:
   - Test Polly.Amy for a British accent
   - Try Polly.Matthew for a male voice
   - Use Polly.Salli for a younger sound

## üéØ Key Improvements You'll Notice:

1. **Natural Speech Patterns**: Automatic pauses between sentences
2. **Better Voice Quality**: Amazon Polly vs basic TTS
3. **Improved Recognition**: Better understanding of caller speech
4. **Conversational Tone**: AI generates more voice-friendly responses

## üí° Tips for Best Results:

- Keep AI prompts focused on short, conversational responses
- Test different voices to find the best fit for your brand
- Consider time of day (professional during business hours, warmer after hours)

## üîß Troubleshooting:

If voice still sounds robotic:
1. Ensure `.env` has `TWILIO_VOICE=Polly.Joanna`
2. Restart the application
3. Check Twilio console for any errors
4. Verify your Twilio account has Polly voices enabled

## üìû Next Steps:

For even higher quality, consider:
1. **OpenAI TTS**: Ultra-realistic voices (requires additional setup)
2. **ElevenLabs**: Premium AI voices (subscription required)
3. **Google Cloud TTS**: WaveNet voices (requires GCP account)
