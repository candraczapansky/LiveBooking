# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: REDEPLOY YOUR REPLIT APP NOW!

## The Problem
Your code is updated locally but the **deployed Replit instance is still running old code**.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Force Redeployment

### Option 1: Through Replit Interface (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Go to your Replit project**
2. **Click the "Deploy" button** (usually in top right)
3. **Select "Redeploy"** or **"Deploy Changes"**
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Option 2: Manual Restart
1. In Replit, go to the **"Shell"** tab
2. Run:
```bash
kill 1
```
This forces Replit to restart everything.

### Option 3: Use Deployments Tab
1. Click the **"Deployments"** tab in Replit
2. Find your active deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**

## What's Been Fixed
âœ… **AI Responder is now integrated directly into your Node.js server**
- No longer depends on Python service
- Will work in deployed environment
- Handles common questions about appointments, services, hours, pricing

## After Redeployment, Test It:
```bash
curl -X POST https://dev-booking-91625-candraczapansky.replit.app/api/webhook/voice/no-answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "DialCallStatus=no-answer&CallSid=TEST"
```

### Should Return:
```xml
<Say voice="alice">
  Hello! Thank you for calling Glo Head Spa. I'm your AI assistant and I'm here to help you today.
</Say>
<Gather input="speech">
  <Say voice="alice">
    Are you calling to book an appointment for one of our amazing head spa treatments...
  </Say>
</Gather>
```

### NOT:
```xml
<Say voice="alice">
  Sorry, all our representatives are busy...
</Say>
```

## Call Flow After Fix:
1. **Call comes in** â†’ Yealink rings
2. **No answer in 10 seconds** â†’ AI responder answers
3. **AI says:** "Hello! Thank you for calling Glo Head Spa..."
4. **Customer speaks** â†’ AI provides helpful responses
5. **Handles:** Appointments, services, pricing, hours

## Alternative: Use Different Domain
If Replit deployment continues to have issues:
1. Deploy to **Railway.app** (free tier available)
2. Or use **Render.com** (free tier)
3. Or point **glofloapp.com** subdomain to your app

## IMPORTANT: Make Sure Twilio Webhook Points to Your URL
After redeployment, verify in Twilio:
- Phone number webhook: `https://dev-booking-91625-candraczapansky.replit.app/api/webhook/voice`
